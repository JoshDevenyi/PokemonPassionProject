# The Pokemon Trainer Tracker

The Pokémon Trainer Tracker is a helpful tool designed to organize and track data for players of the Pokémon franchise of video games. It’s intended as a platform that fans can use to showcase collections of the everybody’s favourite collectable monsters, while also learning specific details about each species. 

# Current Version: 

Information is separated into three main categories: Trainers, Types and Pokémon. Each has full create, read, update, and delete functionality.

A Trainer Page is where users can showcase both information about themselves as well as their collection of Pokémon. 

Whenever a trainer catches something new in the video game, the Pokémon can be added to the page through the use of the dropdown menu at the bottom. Each Pokémon listed serves as a link to their respective Pokémon page. 

Every Pokémon list is organized based on Pokédex number. This keeps organization in line with the video games.

Each Pokémon page lists information about each specific species and well as a list of every Trainer that has caught one.

Images of the Pokémon can be added through their edit page.

Each Type Page showcases lists every Pokémon that belongs to that respective type.

Pokémon Types are color coded. Each Type Page and Pokémon Page showcase this.


   
# Features I’d like to add:

•	Including each Pokémon’s stat information.

•	The ability for trainers to have more than one of the same Pokémon (like in the games)

•	Trading between trainers.

•	Having the trainer data be tied to user accounts.

•	Being able to add a picture when creating a new Pokémon, not just when editing one
